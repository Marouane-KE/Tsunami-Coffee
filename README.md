# Tsunami-Coffee
A Responsive Design Project for the Landing Page of Tsunami Coffee Shop.

I applied my understanding of relative units and responsive web design to enhance the Tsunami Coffee website.

Throughout this project, I made improvements to the existing Tsunami Coffee website code, ensuring that it looks good on various screen sizes. Additionally, I added design elements to make the website more visually pleasing.
